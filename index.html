                <h3 class="headings">What is Dungeons & Dragons?</h3>
                <p>Dungeons & Dragons, or D&D, is a fun and imaginative game to play with family and friends. 
                You can learn valuable skills like teamwork, problem solving skills and how to solve problems creatively 
                and in an out of the box style. The best part is that you are a High Fantasy Characters on an Adventure! 
                Dungeons and Dragons is also a Role Playing Game or an RPG. That means we have to get into character and 
                act, speak, and think like the character. This helps to also enhance your imagination and think from 
                different perspectives.</p>

                <h3 class="headings">How do you play it?</h3>
                <p>The gameplay is simple. There are multiple players, preferably 2-6, and one dungeon master. The Dungeon Master, 
                or DM, places obstacles, monsters, bad guys and other stuff for the players to overcome. You also need Dice. 
                Lots of Dice! The Dice include - D4, D6, D8, D10, D% (or percentile), D12 and, the most useful, powerful and important, 
                D20. D is just die and the number after it signifies the number of sides the dice has. As for the D%, it has 10 sides 
                and is used in conjunction with the D10 to find a number out of 100. For now, the D20 is the one you'll use most often 
                and the one we have to learn about. Now, in D&D, we can't just say to the DM that you want to do this and that. No, 
                we will have to roll the D20 to know if we have succeeded in completing the task or have we failed. According to the role, 
                the DM will describe what you do, see, speak etc. Now, that is a lot to take in. For more information on how to play, 
                watch the video by The Dungeoncast - D&D Explained in 5 minutes.</p>

                <h3 class="headings">The Awesome Classes</h3>
                <p>The D&D also features 12 classes (13 counting the Artificer but, we are not going to cover that). I have divided these classes into 3 categories - Attackers, Supporters and Spellcasters.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Attackers -</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>Barbarian</p>
                    <p>Fighter</p>
                    <p>Monk</p>
                    <p>Paladin</p>
                </ul>
                <p>The Attackers are the ones that deal the most damage to the enemy. They are capable of fighting with weapons or without them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Supporters -</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>Bard</p>
                    <p>Druid</p>
                    <p>Ranger</p>
                    <p>Rogue</p>
                </ul>
                <p>The Supporters are the ones that help out the other player in the battlefield. For example, bards can inspire and enhance abilities of the other players, rogues can do sneak attacks and deal more damage.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Spellcasters -</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>Cleric</p>
                    <p>Sorcerer</p>
                    <p>Warlock</p>
                    <p>Wizard</p>
                </ul>
                <p>The Spellcasters cast the spell on the battle field. They have the most knowledge on spellcasting and fight with a variety of spells.</p>

                <h3 class="headings">The Mysterious Backgrounds</h3>
                <p>There are also 13 backgrounds in Player's Handbook 5th Edition. They are -</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>Acolyte</p>
                    <p>Charlatan</p>

                </ul>
                <p>There are other backgrunds in suppleentary books but, we are sticking to these.</p>

        <section id="S6">
            <div>
                <h3 class="headings">The Ability Scores</h3>
                <p>The Ability Scores in D&D are one of the most important points of the game. They help determine what you are good and bad at and also determine a modifier related to that.
                The Ability Scores are your abilities and there are 6 of them. They are - Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma.</p>
                <p>Let me help explain them in a simple way using tomatoes. Strength is being able to crush a tomato, Dexterity is being able to dodge a tomato, 
                Constitution is being able to eat a rotten tomato, Intelligence is knowing that tomato is a fruit, Wisdom is knowing tp put a tomato in a fruit salad and charisma is being able to sell a tomato based fruit salad.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To calculate our ability scores, we will need 4d6. Roll the dice and drop the lowest number and add the others. Do this 5 more times. 
                Now, according to your character idea, profiencies etc. add the numbers in the boxes on the side of the character sheet. To get the ability modifiers, follow this rule.
                10 is +0. Every even number after 10 gets a +1. So, 12 = +1, 14 = +2 etc. The odd numbers above 10 will have the same modifier as the even number before that. So, 13 = +1, 15 = +2.
                Every odd number below 10 gets a -1. So, 9 = -1, 7 = -2 etc. The even number below 10 will have the same modifier as the odd number after them. So, 8 = -1, 6 = -2.</p>
